This project aims to identify key patterns in criminal activity, focusing on demographic, geographic, and temporal factors that influence crime. By analyzing these variables, the department seeks to better understand high-risk areas, optimize resource allocation, and develop prevention strategies tailored to each neighborhood's unique profile. This approach will support targeted interventions that aim to reduce crime and improve public safety across the city.")
